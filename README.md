Here’s a formatted version of your draft README file for the **Player Match-Based Rater** project:

```markdown
# ⚽ Player Match-Based Rater🌟

## Project Overview

This repository hosts an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline designed to predict football player match ratings. The project serves as a robust demonstration of core MLOps principles, showcasing:

- **Data Ingestion:** Reading and merging disparate data sources (CSV and SQLite).
- **Feature Engineering:** Comprehensive feature creation, including critical per-90 metrics.
- **Model Training:** Training, persistence (.pkl), and systematic evaluation.
- **Automation:** Full pipeline execution via a single shell script (`run_all.sh`).

The model aims to predict player performance scores based on detailed in-game statistics.

## ⚙️ Repository Structure

The project adheres to a standard, scalable directory structure:

```

Player-MatchBased-Rater/

│   └── raw/                     # Raw data (CSV, SQLite, etc.)
├── models/                      # Saved trained model artifacts (Ignored by Git)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally and run the full pipeline.

### Prerequisites

- **Git & Git LFS:** Ensure both Git and Git LFS (Large File Storage) are installed on your machine.

    ```bash
    git lfs install
    ```

- **Python:** Python 3.9 or higher.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IlkinAlishov/Player-MatchBased-Rater.git
    cd Player-MatchBased-Rater
    ```

2. **Create and Activate Environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🏃 Execution

The entire pipeline, from raw data processing to final model evaluation, is executed with a single command.

### Run the Full Pipeline

```bash
./run_all.sh
````

### Pipeline Flow

| Step             | Script                         | Purpose                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ingest**       | `src/ingest/ingest_data.py`    | Combines data from `.csv` and `.sqlite` files.                                         |
| **Prepare Data** | `src/features/prepare_data.py` | Applies cleaning, handles missing data, and creates features like `goals_per90`.       |
| **Train**        | `src/model/train_model.py`     | Trains the regressor model and saves the trained artifact to `models/`.                |
| **Evaluate**     | `src/eval/full_evaluate.py`    | Calculates granular metrics (e.g., MAE by position and rating band) and saves reports. |

## 📊 Results and Output

Upon successful execution, the following artifacts are generated locally:

* **Key Metrics** (Example from `reports/metrics.txt`):

  | Metric                            | Performance |
  | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
  | **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)     | $0.2876     |
  | **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error) | $0.3849     |

* **Output Files**:

  * **Model:** `models/rating_model.pkl`
  * **Full Evaluation Report:** `reports/full_eval.txt` (Contains detailed breakdown of MAE by position and rating band).
  * **Visualizations:** `reports/residual_hist.png` (Visualization of model error distribution).
